**rule of thirds** - No 2 notes in a chord can be greater than a major 3rd apart or less than a minor 3rd apart.  
**note: (does not apply to suspended chords)*

### Triads
| Character | Intervals |
| --------- |:---------|
| major | root, major 3rd, perfect 5th |
| minor | root, minor 3rd, perfect 5th |
| diminished | root, minor 3rd, flat 5th |
| augmented | root, major 3rd, augmented 5th |

### Seventh Chords
| Quality | Triad | 7th interval |
| ------- |:------|:-------------|
| Major 7th | major | major 7th |
| Minor 7th | minor | minor 7th |
| Dominant 7th | major | minor 7th |
| Half-Diminished | diminished | minor 7th |
| Diminished 7th | diminished | diminished 7th |
| Minor Major 7th | minor | major 7th |
| Augmented Major 7th | augmented | major 7th |
| 7sus4 (dominant) | suspended 4th | minor 7th |
| 7sus2 | suspended 2nd | minor 7th |
| M7sus2 | suspended 2nd | major 7th |

### Extended Chords
9th 11th and 13th are static related to chord character.  They are altered independently.
**e.g. CM9 and Cm9 both use the same 9th note.*

-CM11 less common than CM♯11

Notation requires using the highest non altered note:
C11#9 = Natural 11 and sharp 9
C9#11 = Natural 9 and sharp 11
C7#9#11 = Sharp 9 and Sharp 11 (need to go down to 7 for notation)
Altered extensions almost always occur on Dominant chords

### Sixth Chords
C6 - C major chord with a major 6th
Cm6 - C minor chord with a major 6th (same as Am7 chord)

### Poly Chords
C/B - C major and a B major at the same time

### Slash Chords
C/B - C major with a B root

### Suspended Chords
**violates `rule of thirds` shown above*

| Suspension | Intervals |
| --------- |:---------|
| 4 *(most common)*| root, 4th, perfect 5th |
| 2 | root, 2nd, perfect 5th |
| 4 and 2 | root, 2nd, 4th, perfect 5th |

♯⦰♭iiºV+ vii°7  

### Roman Numeral Notation
